# Netflix Recommendation System

## Overview

This project implements a recommendation system for Netflix using collaborative filtering and the cosine similarity function. Python libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn are utilized to analyze user preferences and generate personalized recommendations based on similarity scores. The project aims to enhance user experience by suggesting content similar to what the user has previously enjoyed.

## Project Structure

- `netflix_recommendation_system.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, cosine similarity, and recommendation generation.
- `netflix_data.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset with user ratings and movie details.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library for building predictive models.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## Running the Project
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook netflix_recommendation_system.ipynb in a Jupyter environment.
Make sure to have the netflix_data.csv file in the same directory as the notebook.
Follow the notebook steps for data analysis, cosine similarity computation, and recommendation generation.

## Recommendation System
The collaborative filtering technique based on cosine similarity is employed to identify similar user preferences.
Personalized recommendations are generated for users based on their historical movie ratings and the similarity scores with other users.

## Customization
Modify the dataset or experiment with different recommendation algorithms for improved accuracy.
Explore additional features or metrics to enhance the recommendation system.
